The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to trade, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite.</p><p><strong>You may lose some or all of your invested capital.</strong> Do not invest money you cannot afford to lose.</p><h2>1. Risk of Loss</h2><p>Trading financial instruments involves substantial risk of loss. You may lose all of your initial investment and may be required to pay additional funds. Losses can exceed your initial deposit. You should not trade unless you fully understand the nature of the transactions you are entering into and the extent of your exposure to loss.</p><h2>2. Leverage Risk</h2><p>The use of leverage magnifies both profits and losses. While leverage allows you to control larger positions with a smaller amount of capital, it also increases the risk of significant losses. A small adverse market movement can result in substantial losses that exceed your initial investment.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> With 1:100 leverage, a 1% adverse price movement can result in a 100% loss of your margin.</p><h2>3.
