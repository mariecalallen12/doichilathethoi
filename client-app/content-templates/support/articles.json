You pay swap if the interest rate of the currency you're selling is higher than the one you're buying.</p><h3>When Swap Applies</h3><p>Swap is calculated daily at 00:00 GMT (server time) for positions held overnight. It doesn't apply on Wednesdays (triple swap to account for weekend).</p><h3>Positive vs Negative Swap</h3><ul><li><strong>Positive:</strong> You receive interest (earning swap)</li><li><strong>Negative:</strong> You pay interest (paying swap)</li></ul><h3>Calculating Swap</h3><p>Swap = (Lot Size × Swap Rate) / 10,000 × Number of Days</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Swap rates change with central bank interest rates. Check current rates before holding positions long-term.</p>",
